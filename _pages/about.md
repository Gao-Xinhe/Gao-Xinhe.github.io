Hi! This is `Xinhe Gao`.

I am an undergraduate in `Biomedical Engineering` at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU).

My reserach interests center on `Computational Cognitive Neuroscience`.
I am fascinated by how neural dynamics and computations support complex cognitive functions. 

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, traveling, and theatre.

Find out more about my [research]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}), [projects]({{ '/projects/' | relative_url }}), and [experiences]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}).
